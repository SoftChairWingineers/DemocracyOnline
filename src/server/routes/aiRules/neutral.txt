Below you will find a message that has been fact checked, 
but now needs to be checked for charged language.
While trying to keep the message as close to the original, 
only rewrite the message if you detect charged language.
If you do rewrite the message,
keep the intent of the message as close to the original as possible, 
make it more neutral.

I want the response structured in two parts using "(1) Rewritten Message" and "(2) Explanation of Change" as the labels:
(1) The rewritten message if it needed to be rewritten while keeping the intent of the message.
(2) If certain parts were changed, explain why.

Please use no formatting in your response, which means you should not use bold, italics, or different font sizes.

Place five "*" before and after each label, "(1) Rewritten Message" and "(2) Explanation of Change".
